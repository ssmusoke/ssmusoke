# Manager README

I am putting this down as a guide to working with me, helping me bring out the best in you or bringing out the best in me

## My role 

As Tech Lead, I am measured by:
1. Improving the quality of the technology stack that we are using across our products
2. Support the team to deliver quality software products (develop, deploy, maintain and operate)
3. Remove roadblocks to our software delivery 
4. Ability to facilitate discussions and communication with product owners, stakeholders, customers, and the team members 
5. Coach the software delivery team to bring out their best 

## What do I value most 
1. Planning - fail to plan is planning to fail
  * We have work to do, however we have no idea of how the journey will come together, so we have to set out a route, so that we do not get lost in the weeds. This will allow us to document the journey we are on, share progress (with our stakeholders) and allow us to pivot and adapt as we move along 
  * However sketchy a plan is, it is better than nothing
  * Writing 8 hours of code would have saved us 15 minutes of documentation 
  * Document using the appropraite tools, hand sketch, bold pen, white board so that we can validate as we go along 
2. Kaizen - continous improvement. Whatever we did yesterday or last week, we can do better going forward. We should work to get better while keeping an eye on the deliverables we are working on, as that balance is key. I am hoping you can grow everyday 1% at a time 
3. Continous learning - I am a self-taught techie, trying to learn something new everyday, hoping you will teach me something, and I will do the same
4. I am here to help the product get better, support you to deliver on your role and support your growth - they are not mutually exclusive 
5. I believe hard work gets results, 10,000 hours of learning will get you to mastery of one skill, then another, then another. Hard work is always rewarded, you need to put in the time and energy
6. I aim to find the "and" - solutions what work best within the constraints 
7. 99.5% of decisions can be reversed, let us leave the hard decisions to the last responsible moment
8. Bad news should travel fast - as soon as you know, tell me, so that we can start figuring out mitigation structures
9. We are a team - the sum of the parts is greater than the whole 
10. Enjoy your work, it will show, I am here to bring cheer even in the gloomy days 
11. I may be swamped, but I can make time to talk - take the opportunity, I am a terrible mind reader 

### Personal Quirks
1. I argue, talk loudly and I am pushy - I am working on improving this but it will take time and we shall find a balance that works for us

2. When writing please make it complete - I spell check my SMS messages, so you should do the same to your code and comments 

3. I talk alot so do stop me when you can - do let me know when I go overboard

4. I am a firm believer in progress, show some however little, as this gives me something to work with

5. I am a big fan of process, which is repeatable to yield similar results, once that happens then we can start tweaking it to get improvements 

6. At times all we need is put our heads down and grind, that is the fat frog we need to eat 

### Personality Summary

1. Myers Briggs ENTJ - extroverted, love lists, enjoy plans, focused on facts 

2. Strength Finder - Communicator, Includer, Connected, Learner, Arranger
