# Stephen Senkomago Musoke üá∫üá¨

I am a self-taught software engineer, and technologist at heart who is currently focused on the financial services space working with a startup team within a company building digital payments and collections for small and medium enterprises across Africa. Previously I was in the health technology space, leading the architecture, design, development and rollout of a national Electronic Medical Records system for Uganda, UgandaEMR, based on OpenMRS as well as supporting the build-out of disease surveillance and response initiatives 

I leverage my entrepreneurial experiences and exposure to drive the adoption of technology to achieve business goals whether bringing new products & services to the market, improving the delivery of their existing portfolios, or reaching out to new unknown areas.

I am passionate about growing the technology community in Uganda and on the African continent through ‚ÄúCoded in Africa, for Africans by Africans‚Äù through the use of open-source technologies. 

A personal goal in this journey is working towards having women as equal participants in the African technology revolution
