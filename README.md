I am a self taught software engineer, and technologist at heart who is focused the health technology space, currently leading the architecture, design, development and rollout of a national Electronic Medical Records system for Uganda, UgandaEMR, based on OpenMRS.

I leverage my entrepreneurial experiences and exposure to drive the adoption of technology to achieve business goals whether bringing new products & services to the market, improving delivery of their existing portfolios or reaching out to new unknown areas.

I am passionate about growing the technology community in Uganda and on the Africa continent through ‚ÄúCoded in Africa, for Africans by Africans‚Äù through use of opensource technologies. 

A personal goal in this journey is working towards having women as equal participants in the African technology revolution
